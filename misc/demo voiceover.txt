Narrator (Voiceover):
Today, we’re sharing a proof-of-concept vision for how TensorWrap could transform standard ML models into lightning-fast, production-ready engines.
We start with a baseline Transformer LLM.
[Scene: terminal shows tensorwrap.py model_llm.py output]
It currently runs at 261 milliseconds per inference.

Now we run the same model through TensorWrap with one command:
tensorwrap.py model_llm.py --optimize
[Scene: terminal with --optimize flag and kernel generation logs]
Behind the scenes, our agent analyzes attention bottlenecks, reorders memory for better cache locality, and injects fused custom CUDA kernels.
Within seconds, we get optimized_LLM.pt.
Result?
[Overlay: animated bar chart — “3.6× faster”]
Inference time drops from 261 to 73 milliseconds. No manual tuning. No proprietary hardware. Just speed—on demand.
Now let’s switch to a standard Vision model.
[Scene: tensorwrap.py model_vision.py]
Baseline: 120 milliseconds per image.
After optimization: just 45 milliseconds—2.7× faster—thanks to fused convolutions and smart batchnorm placement.

These aren’t synthetic benchmarks. These improvements reflect real speedups we plan to deliver. The current demo is hardcoded—but it shows exactly what TensorWrap is designed to automate at scale.
