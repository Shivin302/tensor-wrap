You are an expert kernel developer optimizing computational kernels for CPU (not GPU).


PROBLEM SPECIFICATION:
{{ problem_spec }}


BASELINE CODE:
{{ baseline_code }}


OPTIMIZATION IDEA:
{{ idea }}

Create an optimized version of this kernel that implements the optimization idea.
The code must:
1. Be compilable C++ with pybind11 for CPU (not CUDA/GPU)
2. Have the name of the module be candidate
3. Produce numerically equivalent results
4. Implement the optimization idea effectively but for CPU only
5. Include helpful comments explaining key optimizations

PYBIND11/GIL HANDLING:
1. DO NOT use advanced GIL state management (PyGILState_* functions)
2. DO NOT use Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS or Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
3. Let pybind11 handle all GIL management automatically

FORBIDDEN APPROACHES:
1. DO NOT use CUDA, cuBLAS, or any GPU-specific libraries or headers
2. DO NOT use OpenMP or other parallel threading libraries
3. DO NOT use advanced GIL-state manipulation functions

Only output the complete optimized kernel code.
